  title={Smoother: a unified and modular framework for incorporating structural dependency in spatial omics data},
  author={Su, Jiayu and Reynier, Jean-Baptiste and Fu, Xi and Zhong, Guojie and Jiang, Jiahao and Escalante, Rydberg Supo and Wang, Yiping and Aparicio, Luis and Izar, Benjamin and Knowles, David A and others},
  abstract={Spatial omics technologies can help identify spatially organized biological processes, but existing computational approaches often overlook structural dependencies in the data. Here, we introduce Smoother, a unified framework that integrates positional information into non-spatial models via modular priors and losses. In simulated and real datasets, Smoother enables accurate data imputation, cell-type deconvolution, and dimensionality reduction with remarkable efficiency. In colorectal cancer, Smoother-guided deconvolution reveals plasma cell and fibroblast subtype localizations linked to tumor microenvironment restructuring. Additionally, joint modeling of spatial and single-cell human prostate data with Smoother allows for spatial mapping of reference populations with significantly reduced ambiguity.},

  title={A transcriptome-based single-cell biological age model and resource for tissue-specific aging measures},
  author={Mao, Shulin and Su, Jiayu and Wang, Longteng and Bo, Xiaochen and Li, Cheng and Chen, Hebing},
  abstract={Accurately measuring biological age is crucial for improving healthcare for the elderly population. However, the complexity of aging biology poses challenges in how to robustly estimate aging and interpret the biological significance of the traits used for estimation. Here we present SCALE, a statistical pipeline that quantifies biological aging in different tissues using explainable features learned from literature and single-cell transcriptomic data. Applying SCALE to the “Mouse Aging Cell Atlas” (Tabula Muris Senis) data, we identified tissue-level transcriptomic aging programs for more than 20 murine tissues and created a multitissue resource of mouse quantitative aging-associated genes. We observe that SCALE correlates well with other age indicators, such as the accumulation of somatic mutations, and can distinguish subtle differences in aging even in cells of the same chronological age. We further compared SCALE with other transcriptomic and methylation “clocks” in data from aging muscle stem cells, Alzheimer's disease, and heterochronic parabiosis. Our results confirm that SCALE is more generalizable and reliable in assessing biological aging in aging-related diseases and rejuvenating interventions. Overall, SCALE represents a valuable advancement in our ability to measure aging accurately, robustly, and interpretably in single cells.},

  author={Xie, Xuemei and Shi, Qiang and Wu, Peng and Zhang, Xiaoyu and Kambara, Hiroto and Su, Jiayu and Yu, Hongbo and Park, Shin-Young and Guo, Rongxia and Ren, Qian and others},
  abstract={The full neutrophil heterogeneity and differentiation landscape remains incompletely characterized. Here, we profiled >25,000 differentiating and mature mouse neutrophils using single-cell RNA sequencing to provide a comprehensive transcriptional landscape of neutrophil maturation, function and fate decision in their steady state and during bacterial infection. Eight neutrophil populations were defined by distinct molecular signatures. The three mature peripheral blood neutrophil subsets arise from distinct maturing bone marrow neutrophil subsets. Driven by both known and uncharacterized transcription factors, neutrophils gradually acquire microbicidal capability as they traverse the transcriptional landscape, representing an evolved mechanism for fine-tuned regulation of an effective but balanced neutrophil response. Bacterial infection reprograms the genetic architecture of neutrophil populations, alters dynamic transitions between subpopulations and primes neutrophils for augmented functionality without affecting overall heterogeneity. In summary, these data establish a reference model and general framework for studying neutrophil-related disease mechanisms, biomarkers and therapeutic targets at single-cell resolution.},
