Hello! I am a PhD student in Systems Biology at Columbia University supervised by [Raul Rabadan](https://rabadan.c2b2.columbia.edu/) and [David Knowles](https://daklab.github.io/). Prior to Columbia, I received my Bachelor's degrees in Biology and Mathematics from Peking University in 2020, where I worked with [Cheng Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nJd3cIsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) to explore statistical methods for single-cell genomics and multi-omics. During the pandemic I have also worked in a [precision medicine startup](https://genedock.com/) for few months as a bioinformatics engineer.

I am deeply committed to advancing the understanding of human diseases, cancer in particular, through the development of innovative statistical and computational methodologies. At the heart of my research lies a passion for harnessing the power of machine learning and data science, leveraging the rapid advancements in genomic technologies to unlock new insights in biology and healthcare. Key areas of my work include:
- Deciphering the role of alternative splicing in human diseases.
- Illuminating the tumor microenvironment through spatial omics.
- Exploring the nexus between aging and tumorigenesis.
